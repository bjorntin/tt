</div>

## A React Native demo project replicating images gallery app behavior known from [Apple Photos](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photos/id1584215428) or [Google Photos](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.photos&pli=1)

This repository is given to you in chapters, each chapter being hosted on a different branch:

1. [Building Apple & Google Photos Clone in React Native #1 : image list](https://github.com/software-mansion-labs/swm-react-native-labs-swm-photos/tree/episode-1)
2. [Building Apple & Google Photos Clone in React Native #2 : multiplatform](https://github.com/software-mansion-labs/swm-react-native-labs-swm-photos/tree/episode-2)

## Running the project in `developer` mode

1. Check out the episode branch you want to focus on
2. Install dependencies using `bun install`
3. **Set up your unique bundle identifier** (required for iOS builds):
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Update `EXPO_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` with your unique identifier (e.g., `com.swmansion.photos.<SOME_SUFFIX>`)
4. Run the project using `bun android`, `bun ios`, `bun tvos`, `bun androidtv` or `bun web`
   - This command builds the `Release` version of the app on respective platform
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
   - Ensure you have the desired platform available on your machine (e.g. tvOS simulator or AndroidTV device)
5. (Optional) reconfigure the app to launch only the Photos gallery screen by tweaking `EXPO_PUBLIC_LAUNCH_GALLERY_ON_START` env variable.
6. (Optional) seed the device with images, see [Photos seed](#photos-seed) section

>>>>>>> 0b654722dee5f67a3f2b581a069811ef185c1ad7
   - Ensure you have the desired platform available on your machine (either use `Xcode` to install `tvOS` simulator and `Android Studio` to install `AndroidTV` emulator or connect the physical device)
5. (Optional) seed the device with images, see [Photos seed](#photos-seed) section

> [!NOTE]
> If you're having problem with seeing the photos that are available on the photo, please restart the app.
>
> Also, you can use the ⚙️ button to navigate to settings screen and trigger photos re-reading from the device and cache re-calculation (aka generating a mipmap for every photo).

## Running the project in `production` (aka `release`) mode

1. Use the very similar commands as for `developer`, but with `:release` suffix:
   - `bun ios:release`
   - `bun android:release`
   - `bun tvos:release`
   - `bun androidtv:release`
   - `bun web:release`

> [!NOTE]
> Running release commands will trigger native rebuild automatically, so there's no need to prebuild the native project.

## Performance measurements

We've tested the performance using the following preset:

1. Using [`Release`](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/local-app-development/#local-app-compilation) version of the app ([React Native docs recommendation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/performance#running-in-development-mode-devtrue))
2. Set of testing devices
   1. Android Google Pixel 4a
   2. Android Google Pixel 9
   3. iPhone 13 mini
   4. iPhone 16 plus
3. Device orchestration
   1. on Android we use [./scrips/android-adb-orchestration](./scrits/android-adb-orchestration)
   2. on iOS we use manual gestures (there's no known way to automate this)
4. Some measurements were done via JS by storing some timestamps and calculating the average time between several runs of the same procedure.

### iOS Performance profiling

1. Build and run the app on iOS in the Release mode (`bun ios`).
2. In `Xcode` open [`Instruments`](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/instruments)
3. We've used following ones:
   - `Allocations` - for memory measurements
   - `Time Profiler` - for CPU measurements

### Android Performance profiling

1. Build and run the app on Android in the Release mode (`bun android`).
2. In `Android Studio` open [`Profiler`](https://developer.android.com/studio/profile).
3. We've used following ones:
   - `View Live Telemetry` - for memory and CPU measurements.

## Photos seed

Images we use to demonstrate the application are fetched from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).
Several images are available in the repository and could be treated a seed for a photos gallery:

You can use them to populate your device or simulator with number of photos.
Follow [./scripts/populate-device-with-images](./scripts/populate-device-with-images.ts) to do so.
